This repository serves as my **personal laboratory** for DevOps practices, automation, and infrastructure. The main goal is to learn how to build efficient environments and pipelines.

## 🛠️ Technologies Under Study

Here are the core technologies I am focusing on:

* **🐧 Linux & Shell Script:** Task automation directly in the terminal.
* **🐳 Containers:** Docker and Docker Compose for application isolation.
* **🔄 CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (automating tests and deployments).
* **☁️ Cloud:** AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
